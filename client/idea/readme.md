# Working on the SDK repo using IntelliJ

To work on Dart code in the SDK repo, we recommend either IntelliJ Community
Edition or IntelliJ Ultimate.

## Opening from IntelliJ

To open the sdk repo using IntelliJ, choose `File` > `Open...` and select the
`<sdk>/client/idea` directory.

## Opening from the command-line

To open from the command-line, type:

```
idea <sdk>/client/idea
```

This depends on having previously set up the IntelliJ command-line launcher. To
do this, from the `Tools` menu, select `Create Command-line Launcher...`.
